# immoweb-scraper
A script to scrape the immoweb and export to excel

# Development environment
Windows for the moment. Using VScode to operate with a conda environment. In attachment

# Requirements
* geckodriver  
* firefox

# Notes
The original script made in 2021-09-01 was based on firefox and geckodriver but this gave me a lot of pain since I didn't save the environment I 
used to create the analysis. Now I'm using edge and the corresponding driver for that. See [here](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/index.html) for 
more notes and helpful tips.
